XEX2 Hash Test

Copyright (c) 2024 Aiden Isik

This is a test program made during the planning of the FreeChainXenon
project, a fully free/libre homebrew toolchain for the Xbox 360. It
takes an XEX2 file path as it's only parameter and outputs the header
hash found in the XEX file, as well as the calculated header hash.

I have decided to publish this with well-commented code as a resource
for anyone in the future who might want to understand how the hashing is done.

The program does not check for file validity and has no actual checks for
failures. It is expected you give it a valid XEX2 file.

Prerequisites:
 - GNU Nettle library (on Debian: sudo apt install nettle-dev)
 - GCC (on Debian: sudo apt install build-essential)

To compile: gcc main.c -o xex2hashtest -lnettle
